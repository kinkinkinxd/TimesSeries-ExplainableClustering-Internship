# TimesSeries-ExplainableClustering-Internship
This project is an internship focused on studying Clustering with time series datasets.

## PROJECT CONTEXT
Time series mining for prediction and knowledge extraction is a very active field. Two approaches co-exist for this purpose: the univariant approach, which consists in analyzing each time series one by one, and the multi-variant approach, which consists in analyzing several time series together. Moreover, among the existing models in the field of time series mining, we can mention those based on neural networks, set-based approaches, etc. These models are very efficient, but they are not always easy to use and remain black boxes, i.e. the modeling process is opaque and several questions arise on their explicability, the understanding of the result, etc. However, for several years, new societal requirements have been emerging to make the modeling process explainable and transparent in order to provide clear explanations to application domain experts.
Among the different ways to explain an AI model, visual explanations have taken more and more place because they are often the most accessible to all audiences. This project is therefore interested in explaining the results of clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning algorithms used for unlabeled data already investigated in the State of the art.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
This project aims at the investigation and implementation of a methodolgy to explore the
results of the clustering algorithm applied to the time series domains in order to explain them.
